# Comparison chart of (iOS) Mastodon clients

This is a chart driven by obersvations of using each client within the last weeks for some hours. My reading habit is mostly driving the points listed here, as such I'm mostly reading for around 30mins in the morning and evening through a single accounnt (@omich@mastodon.social)[https://mastodon.social/@omich] only.

Each client fullfills the basic features like a timeline view of each account, a thread list view seeing a selected post in context, personal post/direct messages views and some kind of account/setup views.
